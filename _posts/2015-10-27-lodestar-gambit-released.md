At long last I'm happy to announce that [Lodestar Gambit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lodestar.gambit.android) is finally available on Google Play.  I've written a little bit about sound and path scripting code that is in the game, but I'll try to add some more in the near future.

Any downloads/feedback/etc. is greatly appreciated!  It's available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lodestar.gambit.android)
